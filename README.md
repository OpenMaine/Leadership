# Leadership repository

We will store a bunch of stuff here, including notes on the website, outreach, PR &amp; engagement materials. We'll also use the Projects and Issues for leadership to-dos.

These are organizing materials that we primarily use for outreach and engagement with our members. This includes our public-facing website, copy for our Meetup page, and survey/engagement notices to members, as well as other written creative content.
