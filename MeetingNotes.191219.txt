Some notes from OpenMaine meeting on December 19, 2019

Ideas about building involvement and commitment to the group
1. Create roles, and ask people to commit to them for a year (or for six months)
   this would be something that folks could put on their resume
2. Might be nice to have two people in each role
   so that people could cover for each other
3. Need to make a list of the roles that need to be filled
   
Send out an end-of-year message
  descriptions of things the group got done
  thoughts of new projects we're planning
  ... and room to get involved 
  
Some ideas for improving our website:
1. Add 'how-tos', e.g., how to create an online newsletter
2. Add a means for people to contact us (hello@openmaine.org email is all that's needed)
3. Add a means for people to submit project ideas

Some ideas for getting projects started:
1. Observation: Lower-tech nonprofits could get a lot more out of our help
  than more established municipal groups
2. Starting projects by looking at what other groups have done                       
  e.g., kentuckiana and power outages                                             
        scraping data to keep historical record                                   
3. Specific project idea: When are food pantries open?
   just involves collecting info a being a central source
   ideally, so that people could check on their phones, etc.
