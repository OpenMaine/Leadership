• What we'll do
Once a month we gather to discuss and build civic technology at Peloton Labs.

What is civic technology?
Civic technology is the practice of applying rapid prototyping and user centered design to solve civic problems such as voting, budgeting, parking, transit, community engagement, etc., (to name just a few). Civic technologists believe that government services can be efficient, equitable, and open.

Everyone is welcome from all backgrounds and skill levels. We suggest bringing a laptop if you think you'd like to dive in on a project. We share what we are working on at the beginning of each Meetup and introduce all attendees to our Code of Conduct and meeting style. We then have a short featured speaker and a discussion. Project teams are invited to work after the featured speaker, if they like.

Food? Yes. We will provide vegetarian and non-veg food. You are more than welcome to bring snacks to share.

PelotonLabs is a coworking space in the West End of Portland, Maine dedicated to connecting and encouraging people who are stepping out of traditional modes of employment so they can improve their lives and contribute to the world around them. More info: https://www.pelotonlabsportland.com/

So, come hack your city! Everyone is welcome.
